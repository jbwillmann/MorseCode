        <p>
            This helps file was built using Brackets, an open-source code editor. I used Brackets built-in index.html and main.css files that Brackets uses to introduce the program when it is first launched, as templates for this document. It's a good way to start.

        <p>
            I originally published this program on the MatLab side in 2009. This version, as of April 2019, is a major rewrite with many new features. A few of the more notable changes are summarized below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Completely redesigned user interface.</li>
            <li>Improved audio sound.</li>
            <li>Multiple users with preferences saved between sessions.</li>
            <li>Automatically saving new window positions upon closing.</li>
            <li>Consistent naming conventions for variables, functions and callbacks.</li>
            <li>Use of multiple function files to better organize the program and make maintenance simpler.</li>
            <li>Use of .mat files to save important preferences and other control parameters.</li>
            <li>Better and more detailed Help and comments.</li>
            <li>And many more.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3 id="2.0">2.0 About the Program</h3>
        <p>
            This program is a training aid to help the user learn and improve their proficiency in receiving Morse code. The program allows the user to generate Morse code in several ways:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Transmit the alphabet.</li>
             <li>Transmit from a text file.</li>
             <li>Transmit from the keyboard.</li>
             <li>Transmit a recorded .wav file.</li>
         </ul>   
         <p> 
             The code speed (rate of dots and dashes), word speed (period between words) and audio frequency of transmitted dots and dashes can be set separately for each user profile. These parameters can be adjusted through the Preferences drop down menu on the main window.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the program is installed, it is initialized with a default user. The default user parameters cannot be changed. In order to customize the experience, new users must be added. Then the code speed, word speed and frequency can be set as the user desires. This is done through the user preferences drop-down menu on the main  program window. In addition, under the preferences menu is the ability to reset the program to its default state. This will erase any previously established users and their data and return the program to its original startup configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
            When transmitting either a text file or the alphabet, the operator can pause the transmission at any time. When transmitting a file the user must first select a file to be transmitted. The transmission will stop when the end of the file is reached or the transmission is paused by the user. All text in the file is converted to upper case as it is being used and all extra spaces between words are removed. When Transmitting Alphabet the user can select the alphabet content, whether it is transmitted sequentially or randomly, or whether to split the transmitted characters in groups of fixed or random sizes.       
        </p>
        <p>
            When Transmit Keyboard is selected, a window opens showing the keyboard entries and transmitted data. All input is converted to caps and the only special keys accepted are backspace, escape and F5. Backspace will delete the last keyboard input and Escape will clear all entries to start over. F5 is used to start and stop transmission. The imputed text is buffered and transmitted at the selected rates. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            From the menu bar under Help, selecting "Code Table" will display the code table built into the program. There are 60 entries in the table with the last being a word space. Selecting Help will display this file in the MatLab browser. Selecting About will provide author details and version number.
        </p>
        <h3 id="3.0">3.0 Setup and Installation</h3>
        <p>
            The program can be downloaded from the git repository located at <A href="https://github.com/jbwillmann/MorseCode.git">https://github.com/jbwillmann/MorseCode.git</A>. When the downloaded file, MorseCode-master.zip is extracted, the contents of that file is as shown below.
        </p>
        <a href="screenshots/ZipFileContents.png">
            <img alt="A screenshot showing ZipFileContents" src="screenshots/ZipFileContents.png" width="400"/>
        </a>
        <p>
           Each of these files is described in detail at <a href="#5.0">5.0 File and Program Structure</a>, however a few comments are appropriate here. 
        </p>
        <p>
           First, put the folder in your preferred location. You can change the name of the folder if you like. Next open MatLab and navigate to that folder. Then run the main file, Morse.m. The first time it is run it will initialize the program by creating the ProgramData directory and the UserData directory and the main window will open and you will be ready to proceed.
            
        </p>
        <h3 id="4.0">4.0 User Interface</h3>
        <p>
            In this section we review the user interface and describe each of the program windows and its operation.
        </p>
        <h4 id="4.1">4.1 Main Program Window</h4>
        <p> 
             This is the window that opens when the file morse.m is executed. Along the top is a drop down menu which allows you to change user preferences, select a .wav audio file for playback  or use the help system. In the center of the window is the username and the selected user code speed and word speed. Along the bottom are three action buttons allowing the user to either transmit the alphabet, transmit from a saved file, or transmitted code directly from the keyboard.

        <h3 id="6.0">6.0 Design of the Program</h3>
        <p>
            The core of the program is the CodeTable. The function BuildCodeTable creates a 60x4 cell array where the first 3 columns are text and contain the character, dots and dashes, dits and daws. The fourth column is reserved for a wave file that represents the Morse code for that character at the selected speed and audio frequency.
        </p>
       <p>
            After the GUI is constricted, to initialize the program the function FillCodeTable is called. This function first calls BuildCodeTable to populate the first three columns of the CodeTable. Then this function builds the dots dashes and spaces for the selected code and word speed by calling the function MakeWave to build the wave file for a dot, dash and spaces. Then MakeCharacter is called to build the wave file for each character. This result is stored in the fourth column of the CodeTable for each of the character entries in the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            When either the speed or frequency is changed, this process is repeated so there is a new CodeTable constructed to use with the new settings. The process of transmission consist of taking each character of the input stream and sending the wave file associated with that character to the standard audio output using waveplay. Because waveplay does not return until the sample is sent, when sending the alphabet or a loaded text string, the function XmitAlphabet in TransmitAlphabet.m and XmitFile in TransmitFile.m just loop through all of the characters until completed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Transmitting from the keyboard is a bit more complicated. Calling TransmitAlphabet.m opens that window and starts a timer task and  activates the KeyPressFunction. There are 3 special characters the program uses for control. F5 is used to toggle transmission on or off. Escape is used to clear and reset the entries. Backspace is used to clear a keyboard entry while it is in the keyboard entry buffer. If any other character is typed that is not a valid Morse character, the entry is discarded. Otherwise, the character is put into a 2xn cell array InputString. In row 1 is the character and in row 2 is the wave file for that character. 
            All the while this input is going on, the timer task is looking at the InputString to see if there is a new character. It is transmitted if transmission is enabled. The timer task continues and repeats this process until it runs out of characters or transmission is manually stopped.
